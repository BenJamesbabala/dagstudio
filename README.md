# dagstudio
Directed Acyclic Graph Studio with Javascript D3
Create nodes and links in a graph with an intuitive interface.

_Under development!_

The intent is using this to create an interactive and intuitive dag creator (studio) for Caffe layers (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) but its functionality should be more general than that.
